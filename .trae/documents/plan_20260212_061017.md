The error "Upload exceeded 1000 file limit" indicates you are likely uploading the entire project folder (which includes `node_modules` with thousands of files) instead of just the build output.

The `dist` folder currently contains only **3 files**, which is well within the limit.

I will optimize the build configuration to ensure files remain consolidated and guide you on the correct upload process.

### **Plan:**

1.  **Modify `vite.config.ts`**:
    *   Configure `rollupOptions` to merge all third-party dependencies (like React) into a single `vendor` file.
    *   Ensure the build output is strictly consolidated.

2.  **Run Build**:
    *   Execute `npm run build` to generate the optimized `dist` folder.

3.  **Verification**:
    *   Verify the file count in `dist` is minimal (should be < 5 files).

### **Action Item for You (After I finish):**
*   When uploading to Cloudflare Pages, **select only the `dist` folder**, NOT the entire project folder.
